When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	When we have made changes which need to be in the final version so that the collaborators can see the changes. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	So that multiple people can work at the same time.
