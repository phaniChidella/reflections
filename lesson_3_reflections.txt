When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	When we have made changes which need to be in the final version so that the collaborators can see the changes. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	So that multiple people can work at the same time. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork - Copy a repository and give the credit to the original author	
	Clone -  Copy the repository from github to your local computer	
	Branch -  When you have to add a new feature or your team needs to work parallely.
